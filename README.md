# Automating SonarQube Monitoring and Restart on Windows

## Step 1: Create a PowerShell Script

Create a PowerShell script, let's call it `sonarqube_monitor.ps1`, with the following content:

```powershell
$serviceName = "SonarQube"

# Check if SonarQube service is running
$status = Get-Service -Name $serviceName -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

if ($status -eq $null) {
    Write-Host "SonarQube service not found. Starting SonarQube..."
    Start-Service -Name $serviceName
} elseif ($status.Status -ne "Running") {
    Write-Host "SonarQube service is not running. Starting SonarQube..."
    Start-Service -Name $serviceName
} else {
    Write-Host "SonarQube service is running."
}
```

## Step 2: Set Up Task Scheduler

1. Open Task Scheduler by searching for it in the Start menu.

2. Click on "Create Task..." in the Actions pane on the right side.

3. In the General tab:
   - Give the task a name like "SonarQube Monitor".
   - Optionally, provide a description.

4. In the Triggers tab:
   - Click "New...".
   - Choose "Daily" and set the start time to 10:00 AM.
   - Optionally, set a recurrence pattern if you want to run it every day.

5. In the Actions tab:
   - Click "New...".
   - Set the action to "Start a program".
   - Browse and select `powershell.exe`.
   - In the "Add arguments" field, enter the path to your PowerShell script:
     ```
     -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\path\to\sonarqube_monitor.ps1"
     ```
     Replace `"C:\path\to\sonarqube_monitor.ps1"` with the actual path to your PowerShell script.

6. Click "OK" to save the action.

7. Optionally, configure other settings as needed in the Conditions, Settings, and Advanced tabs.

8. Click "OK" to create the task.

Now, the Task Scheduler will run your PowerShell script every day at 10:00 AM. The script will check if the SonarQube service is running and start it if it's not. Adjust paths and timings as needed.
```

You can copy and paste this content into a Markdown file and then publish it on GitHub. Adjustments to the paths and descriptions can be made accordingly.
